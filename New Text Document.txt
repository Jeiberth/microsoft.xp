Can you help me to create a at home routine(i only have 2 dumbells) that fullfill these concepts. Focus on chest, back and arms. Give me negat exersices that i can easily do by myself 

The Muscle-Building Protocol:
 1. Exercises focused on the eccentric (lowering) phase only, using more weight than could be lifted concentrically. 
2. Supersets were used to increase metabolic stress. 
3. Extremely high protein intake (over 400g per day). 
4. Training was only 3 times per week for under 40 minutes.

 Principles and Recommendations: 
- Maximizing mechanical tension on the muscles is key for growth.
 - Exploiting the strength difference between concentric and eccentric contractions. 
- Combining metabolic stress (e.g. supersets) with heavy eccentric loading.

I've been reading several books on how to meet new people and improve small talk, and I‚Äôve taken a lot of notes. However, the notes are currently disorganized and messy.
Please help me by doing the following:

1. **Organize the content** into clear, logical sections (e.g., mindset, conversation starters, body language, how to keep a conversation going, etc.).
2. **Rewrite and improve** the notes for clarity, conciseness, and readability.
3. Turn the content into a **well-structured, easy-to-follow blueprint or cheat sheet** that summarizes the key ideas and actionable tips from the notes.

The end result should be something I can quickly refer to before social events or while practicing social skills.




Say something that is obviously wrong and they will jump to correct you
Say you know this this and this, but no understand well this‚Ä¶ People love to show off their knowledge trough teaching you
When you ask a question, right away make an assumption of the answer of the other person so they will be forced to correct you (so how was the vacation? I bet it was horrible with the worms and mosquitos)
Find similarities(something you like in common or hate in common). And start from there 
Create a short storie(4 sentences) to say after all common questions so you don‚Äôt have to figure them out at the moment (how are you, how was your day, what are your plans on the weekend, how was your weekend )
Warm up before a day where you will socialize, reading out loud a written story exaggerating the expression with your body language 
Use a GOOD MOMENT (sadness, laughs, whatever you both talked about) and use it again referring to it, creating a connections between the both (inside joke)
Don‚Äôt just ask, how are you, how was the weekend‚Ä¶. Ask it and the ask about their feelings, prompt them with a direction, ask for a story like - who did you feel about your weekend? What was the best part? I was so nice outside/ I know you didn‚Äôt just watch a movie at home  
When someone is saying a story, in a high moment add a something in there that high his ego like, ‚Äú I was playing basketball and I avoid everybody and pum‚Äù, me ‚ÄúMAN,  like when Lebrun James left everybody behind‚Äù
When you don‚Äôt know what to say or know nothing about what the other person said, take one of the words she said and generate association and make a question / motorcycle - motor, Yamaha, guajira, √±eros, fast and furious (Practice coming out with random words and getting as many associations as possible)
9 ways to answer in a conversation
- 1, History - personal experiences with the topic 
- 2, Philosophy - opinion on the topic
- 3, Metaphor - what the topic makes me think of
- 4, specific - More details on the topic 
- 5, Broad - Look at it from a bigger perspective, what involves generally the topic
- 6, Related - Related topics
- 7, Emotions - you went skiing!? It seems like u enjoyed a lot (if true, people adds up. If false, people corrects you)
- 8, Restatements - Rephrase what the other person say and ask for validation or just say the last words she said 
Complimment on things she choose and gave a though something that reflects their thinking process ( Hair color if painted, the shoes, anything, but no like her genetics)
Compliment on behaviours/tiks/ma√±as/slangs she has and nobody usually notice 
make them talk a lot, don‚Äôt interrupt them, don‚Äôt change their topic and leave the spotlight to them. 
Do not ask questions yes or no, ask the reason why is the way it is, whether is a yes or no (no, how is your relationship with your mom. YES, why the relationship with your mom is how it is? What happened to get to be that way?
Ask the reason why their beliefs, conclusions, desicion, thoughts 
Ask advice on their area of expertise
Set a monthly goal for social activities 
Start a conversation with an observation of the environments in a question 
Mirrow people expressions, don‚Äôt cross your arms, smile as much as you can in all situations 
Ask how was the persons day? What they did
If am not agree with something someone said and I want to say the opposite, start ‚Äúam agree with you but‚Ä¶‚Äù and the say whatever, they will finish agree with u
When u want to ask for a favor o whatever instead of a yes no question, give two options where the answer is yes, you wanna go to super c by walk or by bus? (Assuming a yes is the answer )

I have to prepare the answer to the routine questions 
I have to analyze how much to see someone at the eyes 

If somebody is explaining u something or whatever and you wanna show you understand them just say ‚ÄúListen/Wait-a-second, Let me be sure I heard what you said. {{ and then you just paraphrase what the other person said, it doesn‚Äôt matter if u are right or no}}
How to make someone do something that you want him to do
Tell him ‚ÄúGo and wash the dishes‚Äù
Then if it doesn‚Äôt work, give him context ‚ÄúGo wash the dishes while I clean the room because we need to get out in 10min‚Äù
Then if it doesn‚Äôt work, give him choices ‚ÄúI could clean the room while you wash the dishes, or you clean the room and I wash the dishes, or I do both and we are not going anywhere, your call‚Äù
Then if it doesn‚Äôt work, ask ‚Äú Is there anything I can say or do to gain your cooperation for you to wash the dishes? I would sure like to think there is‚Äù
Then if it doesn‚Äôt work idk just hit him or kill him whatever üòÇ
Put a name to your ‚Äúweaknesses‚Äù so everytime they show you said in your mind ‚ÄúGo fuck your self Pedro you are not taking over‚Äù
when you do a Presentaci√≥n, analizar what your audience cares about: logic, feelings, results, evidence. And according to that, Taylor your speech
When someone has a problem and you are trying to help him and he is not reasoning. Put yourself in his shoes try to find a solution that from his point of view make sense,l
When somebody comes to you mad as fuck because you did/said something. First thing you say bback ‚ÄúSorry, let me make sure I understood right what u said, you are saying that I did this..‚Äù say it in affirmative avoid ‚Äúyou think‚Äù. When she answered Paraphrase it again, make sure of sounding as you want to solve the issue 
when trying to get info from someone, start asking opinion-seeking questions they will loosen up and then you can go with direct question 
Always praise people to make them feel good, BUT ALWAYS BE AS ESPECIFICC AS YOU CAN LIKE CRAZY, because those type people don‚Äôt get it often you the will remember u
When something happens and u are fucking mad take a deep breath and avoid to talk to that person and just say after we will talk when you cool off 
be specific with people call them by their name, no like soldiers or just people don‚Äôt dehuminiza someone
don‚Äôt brag about u, leave your ego in the side, what people most complaint about their supervisors/managers are their ego and their though that they are better than anybody 
when u wanna learn something, Split it in small actions, and make yourself perfect making each of those actions one by one, and then you will be a master in that something 
What keeps you busy outside of _____(whatever we are doing)?
What is the number one ingredient you attribute your success to?
use people‚Äôs name all the time, and if you see a person and you don‚Äôt remember his name approach him say hi and admit that you forgot his name if you can remaind it 
When going to a social meeting, put a task of meeting n amount of people, and when you do, allow yourself to earlier and enjoy solo time or buy yourself a drink 
Start a conversation like: /* Statment about the context \*,/*Question about the context*\. What a great conference, tell me about the session you attended 
Instead of asking yes/no questions or one word answer questions do this: 
- Do you have kids? & Tell me about u fmly 
- What‚Äôs your favourite hobby & tell me about ur favourite hobby
- where did u go this weekend & Tell me about your weekend 
LEARN TO OBSERVE AT EVERYTHINT
Analyze the person and look for little details nobody would notice, and then ask about it 
How to change topics:
-That reminds me of . . .
-When you were talking about _______, I remembered . . .
-You know, I was just reading a post about . . .
-I‚Äôve always wanted to ask you . . .
-I thought of you when I heard . . .
-Do you mind if I change the subject?
-There‚Äôs something I‚Äôve wanted to ask of someone with your expertise.
if u want to make sure you understood someone or calm down someone, just paraphrase what that person said 
good question: If you weren‚Äôt here, what would you be doing at this very moment?
The key for a good compliment is: _A compliment_ _The reason why you compliment it about that_
- I appreciate how organized you are for our meetings. It makes it easy to get the work done 
- I love your sweater, that shade really enhances the color of your eyes 
Don‚Äôt say what you CANT do instead say what you CAN do. I can‚Äôt meet with you tomorrow - instead - I can meet on Tuesday 
Don‚Äôt say what you hope to do, say what you will do - I will try to get this back to you this week - instead - I‚Äôll get to you no later than next week 
When someone died, the best thing to say ‚ÄúTell me about your dear one‚Äù 
Do not give advice if not asked , instead acknowledge the struggle or stituation the other person is going trough, with simpathy
in hard conversations where debate is strong and there is no middle point usually about politics. Ask ‚Äú What proof would it take to change your mind?‚Äù And if they don‚Äôt answer don‚Äôt waste your time 
when you want to stop taking with somebody, brought up the first topic that you started with like this ‚ÄúPedro, it‚Äôs been wonderful talking with you about ______.***‚Äù ***:
- I promise myself that I‚Äôd meet three new people before I leave this evening
- I want to get around and say hello to everyone at this meeting 
- I am going to circulate and meet some of the new members 
other way to do it and at the same time get what you are looking for is just asking straight forward like:
- Julian, can you suggest me anyone with whom I could speak about____?
- Karen, do you know anyone who might have some ideas about where I could find an engineering opportunity?
And when pointed to someone just go to that person and say ‚Äú Hi, I was just talking with Juliana, and she told me that you are an engineer‚Äù
other way to exit or achieve your goal when talking with someone, is asking them to join you in the journey, like this ‚Äúlet‚Äôs circulate, I promise myself I would meet some new people ‚Äú 
A way to say to a person Business or personal wise that you want to keep in touch ‚Äú I am glad to meet you and I would like to learn more about your organization. Would you like to join me for a cup of coffe next Wednesday?‚Äù
don‚Äôt say ‚ÄúI understand your feelings‚Äù or share a similar story trying to show simpathy. Just say ‚Äòthat must be so frustrating‚Äù when Someone is expressijg something that makes him feel bad 
Conversation starters:
- Working anything exciting these days?
- Have any vacations coming up?
- Anything good happen today?

Hello Mr. Sabbag,

I recently applied for the Full-Stack Web Developer position at Hart Print. I‚Äôm reaching out directly because I'm genuinely excited by the prospect of joining your team and contributing to a company at the intersection of technology, design, and sustainability.

I'm particularly drawn to Hart Print's mission of empowering brands by turning infinitely recyclable cans into art. It‚Äôs an innovative and inspiring goal.

My experience in architecting scalable e-commerce platforms and SaaS solutions using a similar stack (React, Laravel, AWS) aligns directly with the needs of your B2B portal. For example, at D2Technologie, I optimized a system for over 2,500 SKUs, which I believe is relevant experience that could help contribute to improving your portal's data integrity for the future data warehouse and analytics projects you're spearheading.

As a developer, I was immediately impressed by your website's fantastic use of Three.js to bring the can designs to life‚Äîit truly reflects Hart Print's innovative spirit. My own experience building an AR menu platform with the same technology sparked an idea. I believe there's a powerful opportunity to expand upon your current implementation by creating a fully interactive 3D/AR preview tool within the client portal. This would empower clients to see their custom artwork rendered on a can in real-time, significantly streamlining the approval process.

My CV is attached for your convenience and provides more detail on my projects. I am confident that my skills can bring significant value to your team.

Would you be open to a brief chat next week to discuss this further?

Best regards,

Jeiberth Malagon

Hi Hudson,

I hope this message finds you well. As a fellow Vanier College alumnus, I was excited to come across your profile while researching opportunities at Aylo. I'm Jeiberth Malagon, a full-stack developer with over three years of experience building scalable web applications, and I've recently applied for the PHP Developer position through Greenhouse.

I'm eager to join Aylo and contribute to your innovative team. I particularly admire Aylo's mission of providing trusted environments to enable the safest user experiences and empower communities by celebrating diversity, inclusion, and expression‚Äîall while leading the industry in adult entertainment platforms.

With my background in PHP frameworks like Laravel, alongside expertise in JavaScript, real-time systems (e.g., WebSockets), and cybersecurity measures such as OAuth, JWT, 2FA, and database encryption, I believe I could contribute to improving the scalability and security of your high-traffic platforms. For instance, I think your team could benefit from enhanced data optimization techniques I've implemented in projects handling thousands of transactions, or by bolstering trust-and-safety protocols like content fingerprinting and moderation tools to further deter misuse and ensure robust user protection.

I've attached my CV for your reference, which details my projects, including a scalable e-commerce platform and a real-time marketplace app that align well with Aylo's focus on big data, microservices, and secure, high-volume websites.

I'd love to hop on a quick chat to discuss how my skills might support Aylo's goals or explore ways we could connect further. Are you available for a brief call sometime next week?

Thank you for your time, Hudson. Looking forward to hearing from you!

Best regards,

Hi Martin-Pierre,

My name is Jeiberth Malagon, and I'm a Full-Stack Developer with a strong background in Laravel and building scalable web applications. I recently submitted my application for the Backend Developer role through the Blax website, but I wanted to reach out directly to express my strong interest.

I've been following Blax's work and I'm particularly drawn to your mission of creating custom, high-impact web solutions from the ground up, moving beyond standard CMS platforms. Your focus on having full control over a project's appearance and performance really resonates with my own development philosophy. I want to work at a company that values that level of craftsmanship.

Looking at your portfolio and the technologies you use, I see a strong alignment with my experience. For example, I‚Äôve architected e-commerce platforms and real-time systems using Laravel, Vue.js, and CI/CD pipelines, which seems very similar to your tech stack. I believe I could contribute to improving and building upon your backend systems, especially given my experience in optimizing database performance and automating deployments. I think your team could leverage my skills in microservices architecture to further enhance the scalability of your client projects.

My CV is attached for your convenience, which provides more detail on my projects and technical skills.

I would appreciate the opportunity to discuss how my background could benefit the Blax team. Would you be open to a brief chat next week?

Best regards,
